This is called the \"electrostatic approximation\".\nThe validity of the electrostatic approximation rests on the assumption that the electric field is irrotational, or nearly so:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        ∇\n        ×\n        \n          E\n        \n        ≈\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nabla \\times \\mathbf {E} \\approx 0.}\n  \n\nFrom Faraday's law, this assumption implies the absence or near-absence of time-varying magnetic fields:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              ∂\n              \n                B\n              \n            \n            \n              ∂\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        ≈\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\partial \\mathbf {B}  \\over \\partial t}\\approx 0.}\n  \n\nIn other words, electrostatics does not require the absence of magnetic fields or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents do exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must change with time only very slowly. In some problems, both electrostatics and magnetostatics may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. Electrostatics and magnetostatics can both be seen as non-relativistic Galilean limits for electromagnetism. In addition, conventional electrostatics ignore quantum effects which have to be added for a complete description.\n\n\n=== Electrostatic potential ===\n\nAs the electric field is irrotational, it is possible to express the electric field as the gradient of a scalar function, \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n, called the electrostatic potential (also known as the voltage).

This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the surface amounts to:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              ε\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          E\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P={\\frac {\\varepsilon _{0}}{2}}E^{2},}\n  \n\nThis pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of the surface charge.\n\n\n== See also ==\nElectromagnetism – Fundamental interaction between charged particles\nElectrostatic generator, machines that create static electricity.\nElectrostatic induction, separation of charges due to electric fields.\nPermittivity and relative permittivity, the electric polarizability of materials.\nQuantization of charge, the charge units carried by electrons or protons.\nStatic electricity, stationary charge accumulated on a material.\nTriboelectric effect, separation of charges due to sliding or contact.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHermann A.
