## üîß Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment templates
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.example Backend/.env

# Edit configuration files with your values
# Required: API keys, database passwords, security keys
```

### Step 2: Deploy Services
```bash
# Option A: Automated deployment
./deploy_production.sh          # Linux/Mac
deploy_production.bat           # Windows

# Option B: Manual deployment
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Run health checks
python health_check.py

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000      # Frontend
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Backend API
```
